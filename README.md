# SaveTabsBrowserExtension

_A simple browser extension that allow user to save all opened tabs in the current browser window._

## Why this extension

You got me. I'm one of those people in the world which continusly opens tabs in his browser windows. And then never close them. The fact is, usually I somehow need them, so when I stop working I truly hopes that cronology restore of the browser will work well next time I open it.

**I'm wrong, of course.**

Never happened to you to open the browser just to quick check a fact and shut down the PC just some seconds later? Then a lot of times the browser will mark your last visited page, but will clean up all the previous group of tabs that you _wanted_ to keep in your browser chronology menu. 

**Shame! Shame! Shame!**

So I've quickly done a lightweigth extension just to save the tabs URIs to a simple txt file. 

## Ok, how it works?

Simply and clean. By now, it's **UGLY**, as I'm no artist with HTML5 design techniques. I'm kinda derp with it when it's not for work. And I'm lazy when working on prototypes of this kind. Just think this extension as an help, not a bystanding full grown product.
So, it will simply create a TXT file that will be "downloaded" by your browser where you want. The file format is:

` * <Name of the tab, as it's shown by the browser> - <URI of the tab, as in browser address box> `

Simple? Yes, it is!

## Weeeell. Now how I can use it?

Uh. As you can see, it's not a packaged extension by now. So this mean you must activate developer mode in your browser and intall it as an unpacked extension.
How will you do this magik trick? As always, based on browser it is. MMMHH!

### Chrome

Using Chrome, just go to the extension manager, on the top-right of the page you will find a switch to _*"Enable developer mode"*_ . This will popup three buttons on the top-left corner of the manager dashboard, one of which will be _*"Load unpacked extension"*_ . Here you are. Use this command to select the folder where you download the source of this magical extension and Chrom will do all the trick for you.

### Edge

With Edge, the story is somehow the same, but with a different fancy Windows11-esque layout. "Enable developer mode" in in the middle-left zone of the extension manager page, while the "Load unpacked extension" is in the top-right area. The installation flow is the very same from Chrome.
